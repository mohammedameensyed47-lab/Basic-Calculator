Basic-Calculator


Implementation of a simple Python-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations.
CSA2001: Basic Calculator Project
Overview
This project implements a basic calculator in Python capable of performing four fundamental arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It is designed as a beginner-friendly program to demonstrate user input handling, conditional logic, and function-based program structure.
Features
Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Handles invalid inputs and division-by-zero safely.
Clear, interactive text-based interface.
Modular structure for easy understanding and extension.
Installation & Requirements
Python 3.8+ (tested on Python 3.12).
No external libraries required.
Simply download and run the script.
How to Run
1. Clone or download the project folder.
2. Open the terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the calculator using:
python calculator.py
Program asks for two numbers and an operation, then prints the result.
Input & Operation Flow
User enters first number.
User enters second number.
User selects an operation (+, -, *, /).
Calculator validates inputs and displays the final answer.
Testing & Validation
Handles non-numeric input with error messages.
Checks for division by zero.
Ensures proper operator selection.
Tested across multiple inputs for accuracy and stability.

Future Enhancements
Add more operations (power, modulus, square root).

Add a GUI version using Tkinter.

Include history of calculations.
